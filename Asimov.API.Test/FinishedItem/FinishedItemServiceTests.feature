Feature: FinishedItemServiceTests
	As a Developer
	I want to complete an Item through API
	So that It can be available for applications.
	
	Background: 
		Given the Endpoint https://localhost:5001/api/v1/items is available for FinishedItemServiceTests
		Then A Course is already stored in the table courses
		  | Id | Name    | Description                | State |
		  | 1  | Algebra | A branch of Mathematics... | false |
		And A Item is already stored in the table items
		  | Id | Name  | 					Value                  | State | CourseId |
